## Overview
Fictional biological researcher, Roza has partnered with fictional food startup 'Improbable Beef' to research bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Roza hypothesized that the next great bacteria can be found in most human bellybuttons, which is why she tasked us with creating a web-based dashboard that potential research volunteers could use to determine if they're eligible to sell their bacteria to Improbable Beef, and fellow researchers can use to view the most common bacteria. Rozas end goal for this dashboard is to display the most common bacteria species found in the human bellybutton, and identify which species can synthesize proteins that taste like beef, which would be harvested and sold to 'Improbable Beef.'

## Results
The web-based dashboard allows researchers to view the most common forms of bellybutton bacteria with ease, and allows volunteers to determine if they're eligible to sell their bacteria to 'Improbable Beef' based off of the bellybutton bacteria they harbor. To simplify the process, a horizontal bar chart unique to every volunteer is displayed on their dashboard highlighting the top 10 most common species of bacteria located in their bellybutton, which they can quickly use to determine their eligibility with 'Improbable Beef'. To confirm the results are accurate, users can view the demographic information associated with their Test Subject ID No. to guarantee they have not entered the wrong dashboard accidentally. An interesting addtion to the dashboard that can potentially impact the volunteers likelihood of harboring 'rare' bacteria is the gauge chart which displays the number of belly button scrubs per week; obviously, the more scrubs per week, the less likely the 'rare' bacteria will remain. 

One recommendation for the research process would be providing guidelines to preserve the bacteria, such as do not wash your bellybutton for 3-5 days before submitting a sample, to help eliminate the risk of a false negative. Logically speaking, there can be plenty of volunteers whose sample is tarnished due to over-washing or over-scrubbing of their bellybutton, which minimized or eliminated the 'rare' bacteria from their sample.
